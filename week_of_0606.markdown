It's taken about a year to get here and now that I am here, it's time to
compare expectations versus actual. I have spent a few months going over
Ruby tutorials like RubyMonk, Code School, learn.thoughtbot, etc. I have been
reading books like David Black's "Well Grounded-Rubyist" and Olsen's "Elegant
Ruby." There was even a brief collision with DBC in there '0 Phase' for about
6 weeks. Did I feel prepared?

Yes. Sort of.

The pace during this first week has been interesting for sure. The first few
days were the typical team building stuff like building the room's furniture,
going on a city scavenger hunt, and the "go-around-the-room-telling-us-about-
yourself-thing." We also did some TDD right out of the gates with MiniTest and
I felt great about both the TDD and Ruby exercises. So, after Thursday I was
feeling really confident.

Then today.

Friday, was more of a grind as we worked with our MicroBlogger. I've been blessed
to be paired with some really helpful people and together we are grinding
it out. I still feel pretty good about Ruby and my abilities but it was a bit
more uphill today. You learn quick who knows shit and who wishes they did.

I would say to the room in general that we need to ask for help more often and
sooner. I will continue to sharpen my typing skills which will really help me
look like I know what I'm doing even if I really don't.
